{"name":"Visual Analytics","tagline":"Database-driven, web-based data visualisation","body":"### Welcome to Visual Analytics\r\nThis project aims at creating a tool to easily visually explore data stored into a NoSQL database through your web browser. Here's how to setup the server:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git pull va\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ node app\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Database driven\r\nThe data gets pulled from the web and is stored in a MongoDB database. Next, the data is pulled from the database, passed through a crossfilter and visually laid out through the dc and d3 Javascript libraries. The slice and dice and interactivity of the charts is made possible by the crossfilter Javascript module.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThis project is being developed by CÃ©dric Warny (@cwarny).
